## **FIRST BE SURE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING** And you have checked and tested Hellbomb script first

Click to go to [HellbombScript](https://github.com/helldivers2fixes/HellbombScript/tree/main)

This script delete helldivers registerkeys and folder under %appdata% what can cause problem if normal reinstall not fix the problem, there can still have some other registerkeys example what Nvidia can make for helldivers, I cant delete all of these so this script delete only keys what helldivers itself bring and leave behind after uninstalling. You maybe want double check register manually if some other program have made own registerkey for helldivers what can cause problem.

If you are not sure is this script save or not you can alway ask AI or Reddit or anywhere else what you trust is this save to use and do this script do what I say it to do.

If you see red warning with "Access is denied" message start your powershell again and be sure you start as administrator, this script not work without because it make change to register.
